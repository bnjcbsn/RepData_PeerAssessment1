## Loading and preprocessing the data
``` {r}
rough<-read.csv("activity.csv")
library("dplyr")
daystep<-summarize(group_by(rough, date), s=sum(steps), m=mean(steps), j=median(steps))

```



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
``` {r}
hist(daystep$s)

```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
stepmean<-mean(daystep$m, na.rm = TRUE)
stepmedian<-median(daystep$m, na.rm = TRUE)
```
1. The mean of the total number of steps taken is `r stepmean`.  

2. The median of the total number of steps taken is `r stepmedian`.  

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
``` {r}
intstep<-summarize(group_by(rough, interval), ave=mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
plot(intstep, type='l')
```


## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
